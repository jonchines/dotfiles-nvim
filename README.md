# dotfiles-nvim

The Neovim configurations for jonchines.

## nvim

This is my default Neovim configuration for my work in DevOps. It is configured for Terraform, Ansible, shell scripts,
Typescript, and other such tools for managing cloud platform deployments.

## nvim-logs

This is a secondary configuration for opening large logs. The keybindings are generally the same as the default config
with less plugins - specifically Treesitter and LSP are removed to help reduce load times and motion within very large
log files. Of course, it still is not as good as tools like Klogg.
